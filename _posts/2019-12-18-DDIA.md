Data-intensive systems involved:

- Store data(databases)
- Caches,to remember the result of expensive operations
- search index.
- Stream processing
- batch processing:periodically process a large of accumulated data batches

But in reality,there are various appraoches to handle the forwading questions

Many tools for data storage and processing have emerged.(Redis,Kafka....),the boundaries between the categories are becoming blurred.

*One possible architecture for a data system that combines several components*

Several questions:

- How to ensure the data remain correct and complete?
- How to provide consistently good performance to clients?
- How to scale to handle an increse to load?
- How to design the API?

## Three concerns that are important in most systems

1. Reliability
2. Scalability
3. Maintainability

## Reliablity

## Scalability

### Describe Load--(use load parameters)

How to resolve two operations:follow and be followed

1. 
2. 

Do more work at write time and less at read time

### Describe performance

We care about *throughput*:the number of records we can process per second.
