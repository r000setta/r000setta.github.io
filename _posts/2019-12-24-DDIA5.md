Replication means keeping a copy of the same data on multiple machines that are connected via a network.
The main difficulty in replication lies in handling changes to replication data.

## A Simple Introduction about Distributed Data
Some reasons why you might distribute a database across multiple machines.
* Scalability:Data volume grows bigger than a single machine could handle.
* Fault tolerance/high availability:When one fails,another one can take over.
* Latency:Keep data geographically close to your users.

### Scaling to Higher Load
An simple way is to buy a powerful machine,which is called vertical scaling.But the problem of this shared-memory architecture is that the cost grows faster than linearly.
Another approach is the shared-disk architecture,uses several machines with independent CPUs and RAMs,this is used for some data warehousing workloads.

#### Shared-Nothing Architectures
In this approach,each machine or virtual machine running the database software is called a node.Any coordination between nodes is done at the software level, using a conventional network.

Two common ways data is distributed across multiple nodes:

* Replication:Keeping a copy of the same data on several different nodes, potentially in different locations,which provides redundancy.
* Partitioning
