## A Simple Introduction about Distributed Data
Some reasons why you might distribute a database across multiple machines.
* Scalability:Data volume grows bigger than a single machine could handle.
* Fault tolerance/high availability:When one fails,another one can take over.
* Latency

### Scaling to Higher Load
An simple way is to buy a powerful machine,which is called vertical scaling.But the problem of this shared-memory architecture is that the cost grows faster than linearly.
