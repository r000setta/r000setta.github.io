## Basic Shape Interface
All shapes are defined in coordinate space,in order to place them to world space,a transformation must be provided.
Shapes take parameter *reverseOrientation* to indicates their surface normal direction,and store *SwapHandedness* for their object-to-world transformation.

### Bounding
As the render process is often expensive,it's useful to have a 3D bounding volume that encloses the object,which can avoid process things the volumes didn't evolved.

Here use axis-aligned bounding boxes,which require six floating-point values to store,and the render provides two methods:
* ObjectBound():returns a bounding box in shape's object space.
* WorldBound():returns a bounding box in world space.
> Note:The default implementation of the WorldBound() is just to transform the object space bounding box to world space,but it's sometimes sloppy,and it could be better if first transform then fit the bounding box.
