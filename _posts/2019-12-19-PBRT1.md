## Basic Shape Interface
All shapes are defined in coordinate space,in order to place them to world space,a transformation must be provided.
Shapes take parameter *reverseOrientation* to indicates their surface normal direction,and store *SwapHandedness* for their object-to-world transformation.

### Bounding
As the render process is often expensive,it's useful to have a 3D bounding volume that encloses the object.
