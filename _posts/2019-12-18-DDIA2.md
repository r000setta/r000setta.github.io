## The Object-Relational mismatch

Traditional object-relational sql has a servely mismatch between the code and sql-table,which is called *impendance mismatch*.

Althrough ORM frameworks could reduce the amount of boilderplate,but it can't completely hide the difference between two models.

It's true that JSON model reduces the impendance mismatch between the code and the storage layer,but it still has shortcoming:*Schema flexibility in the document model*.

## Many-to-One and Many-to-Many

### Schema flexiblity in the document model

Document databases was also called schema-on-read:the structure of the data is implict,and only interpreted when the data is read.It's similar to runtime type checking.

## Query Languages for Data

### Declare queries

In some cases,using declarative language is much better than imperative languages.(CSS,database)

### MapReduce quering

A limited form of MapReduce is supported by NoSQL datastories.

The logic of the query is expressed with snippets of code,based on the map and reduce functions.

They must be pure functions,which means they only use the data that is passed to them as input,and can't perform additional database queries,can't have any side effects.

## Graph-Like Data Models

If many-to-many relationships are very common and complex,it's nature to use graph to model the data.

### The Cypher Query Language

Cypher is a declareative query language for property graphs.

## Summary

The traditional tree data models wasn't good for representing many-to-many relationships, the relational model can solve it partway.New nonrelational "NoSQL"

has diverged in two main directions:

1. *Document databases*:
2. *Graph databases*

All three models are widely used today.

Each data model comes with its own query language or framework.
